This is the code for the "How to Deploy a Tensorflow Model in Production" by Siraj Raval on YouTube

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/T_afaArR0E8) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. We're going to use the [Tensorflow Serving](https://tensorflow.github.io/serving/) library to deploy an inception model in production. 

## Dependencies

All included in the iPython notebook. You just need [docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Usage

Run the notebook by running `jupyter notebook` in terminal in the main directory. All the instructions are in there. 

The 2 attached files -- one is the client and the other is an example of how we train and save an simple MNIST model for Tensorflow Serving.  

## Credits

Credits go to Google. I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
